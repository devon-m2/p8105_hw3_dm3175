Problem 1
=========

The BRFSS dataset includes data from the Behavioral Risk Factors Surveillance System from 2002-2010. This dataset is located in the `p8105.datasets` package. The same dataset was used in homework 2.

Import and Clean Dataset
------------------------

Loaded and cleaned BRFSS data from `p9105.datasets` package:

``` r
brfss_data = p8105.datasets::brfss_smart2010 %>% 
    janitor::clean_names() %>%
    filter(topic == "Overall Health") %>% 
    mutate(response = factor(response, levels = c("Excellent", "Very good", "Good", "Fair", "Poor")))
```

The following steps were taken to clean the dataset:

-   Cleaned variable names using `janitor::clean_names`.

-   Verified variable types imported correctly.

-   Filtered data to only consider "Overall Health" topic.

-   Using the `factor` function, organized the responses as a factor ordered with 5 levels: `Excellent`, `Very good`, `Good`, `Fair`, and `Poor`.

Questions
---------

-   **In 2002, which states were observed at 7 locations?**

Using a combination of `group_by` and `summarize` functions, it can be found that in 2002, the following states were observed at 7 locations. Note that other states were observed at less than or greater than 7 locations.

``` r
brfss_data %>% 
  filter(year == 2002) %>% 
  group_by(locationabbr) %>% 
  summarize(count_locations = n_distinct(locationdesc)) %>% 
  filter(count_locations == 7) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 1)
```

| locationabbr |  count\_locations|
|:-------------|-----------------:|
| CT           |                 7|
| FL           |                 7|
| NC           |                 7|

-   **Make a “spaghetti plot” that shows the number of locations in each state from 2002 to 2010.**

The following spaghetti plot displays the number of locations in each state from 2002 to 2010. The states are differentiated by colors as presented in the legend.

``` r
brfss_data %>%
  group_by(year, locationabbr) %>% 
  summarize(count_locations = n_distinct(locationdesc)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = count_locations, color = locationabbr)) + 
  geom_line(se = FALSE) +
  labs(
    title = "Number of Sampling Locations in Each State, 2002 to 2010",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Number of Distinct Sampling Locations",
    caption = "Data from the BRFSS 2010 Dataset"
  ) + 
  theme_bw()
```

-   **Make a table showing, for the years 2002, 2006, and 2010, the mean and standard deviation of the proportion of “Excellent” responses across locations in NY State.**

The following table displays the mean and standard deviation of the proportion of "Excellent" responses across locations in NY State.

``` r
brfss_data %>% 
  filter(locationabbr == "NY" & 
           (year == 2002 | year == 2006 | year == 2010) &
           response == "Excellent") %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  summarize(mean_excellent_response = mean(data_value),
            sd_excellent_response = sd(data_value)) %>%
  knitr::kable(digits = 1)
```

|  year|  mean\_excellent\_response|  sd\_excellent\_response|
|-----:|--------------------------:|------------------------:|
|  2002|                       24.0|                      4.5|
|  2006|                       22.5|                      4.0|
|  2010|                       22.7|                      3.6|

-   **For each year and state, compute the average proportion in each response category (taking the average across locations in a state). Make a five-panel plot that shows, for each response category separately, the distribution of these state-level averages over time.** \*\*\*\*\*FINISH\*\*\*\*\*

``` r
brfss_data %>%
  group_by(year, locationabbr, response) %>% 
  summarize(mean_response = mean(data_value))
```

    ## # A tibble: 2,215 x 4
    ## # Groups:   year, locationabbr [?]
    ##     year locationabbr response  mean_response
    ##    <int> <chr>        <fct>             <dbl>
    ##  1  2002 AK           Excellent          27.9
    ##  2  2002 AK           Very good          33.7
    ##  3  2002 AK           Good               23.8
    ##  4  2002 AK           Fair                8.6
    ##  5  2002 AK           Poor                5.9
    ##  6  2002 AL           Excellent          18.5
    ##  7  2002 AL           Very good          30.9
    ##  8  2002 AL           Good               32.7
    ##  9  2002 AL           Fair               12.1
    ## 10  2002 AL           Poor                5.9
